struct Constants {
    static let mercuryD = "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest planet to the sun. It is also the fastest planet. Mercury travels around the sun every 88 earth days. Mercury has craters like the Earth's moon and is about the same size as our moon. It is unlikely life could ever survive on Mercury due to the heat and radiation from its proximity to the sun."
    static let mercuryS = "Closest to the sun."
    static let mercuryF = "Even though Mercury is very hot it still has ice on its surface.  The ice can be found in craters that are shielded from the sun. One theory is that ice and other organic matter were brought to Mercury by comets."
    static let venusD = "Venus is the planet closest to the Earth and is the second planet from the sun. It is sometimes called Earth's \"toxic twin\" because while it is similar in size and density, it also has a toxic atmosphere. It is filled with carbon dioxide clouds of sulphuric acid that get trapped in the atmosphere creating a greenhouse effect.  Because of this, Venus is even hotter than Mercury.  At about 900 degrees F, it is hot enough to melt lead. The surface of Venus has mountains and possibly active volcanoes."
    static let venusS = "Earth's closest neighbor."
    static let venusF = "Venus spins in the opposite direction from most planets. There the sun rises in the west and sets in the east."
    static let earthD = "Earth is the only planet we know of to support life. It is the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on its surface. Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 28 percent oxygen and 1 percent miscellaneous - the perfect balance for living things. All of the planets except for earth were named for Greek gods or goddesses. Earth comes from a German word meaning \"the ground\"."
    static let earthS = "Our home planet."
    static let earthF = "Earth has a magnetic field that protects us from radiation from the sun. Auroras are caused when particles from the sun travel along the magnetic field and interact with Earth's atmosphere."
    static let marsD = "Mars is cold and dusty with a very thin atmosphere and a rocky terrain. Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos. Evidence suggests Mars was once warmer and wetter with a thicker atmosphere. Like Earth, there are seasons on Mars. There are other similar features to Earth, like polar ice caps and volcanoes. On day on Mars takes a little over 24 Earth hours. Mars is known as the \"Red Planet\" due to iron in the soil."
    static let marsS = "The \"Red Planet\"."
    static let marsF = "Mars is the most explored of all the planets. It is the only planet we have sent rovers to explore the surface.  NASA currently has two rovers, a lander, and a helicopter exploring the surface of Mars. We are hoping to learn more about Mars' past and whether it would be possible to inhabit Mars in the future."
    static let jupiterD = "Jupiter is twice as large as any other planet in our solar system. The giant red spot on Jupiter is actually a storm that is centuries-old."
    static let jupiterS = "The largest planet."
    static let jupiterF = "Because Jupiter is so large (318 x larger than Earth), it attracts comets and asteroids as they pass by and catches them into its atmosphere."
    static let saturnD = "Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system. The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. What looks like rings around Saturn is actually a field of ice and rock.  It is possible a moon broke apart and formed the debris, but we don't know for sure. Saturn has a total of 82 moons (some are pending confirmation of the discovery). It takes Saturn 29 Earth years to orbit the sun."
    static let saturnS = "Known for its rings."
    static let saturnF = "Part of Saturn's mass includes a 22 ton spacecraft from Earth called Cassini that was vaporized in Saturn's atmosphere in 2017 (intentionally)."
    static let uranusD = "Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope. It was named for the Greek god of the sky. It is four times wider than the earth and it takes 84 Earth years to orbit the sun. Uranus has a rocky core surrounded by icy water, methane and ammonia. It's atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium and methane. Uranus has 13 rings and 27 known moons, all named from characters from Shakespeare and other classic literature."
    static let uranusS = "Spins on its side."
    static let uranusF = "Uranus rotates at a 90 degree angle from its orbital plane, which makes it look like it is spinning on its side."
    static let neptuneD = "Neptune is cold, dark and windy. It is the eighth planet from the sun.  It was the first planet to be discovered using mathematical calculations rather than by a telescope. Neptune's 14 known moons are all named after Greek sea gods and nymphs. Because Pluto, the dwarf planet, has an eliptical orbit, it is sometimes closer to the sun than Neptune."
    static let neptuneS = "Has supersonic winds."
    static let neptuneF = "Neptune has supersonic winds that blow at more than 1,100 miles per hour. An F-5 hurricane blows from 251-318 mph."
