"It is a beautiful and delightful sight to behold the glory of the moon" - Galileo Galilei

The Earth's moon was likely formed when a large body the size of Mars crashed into the Earth and the moon was formed by the debris.  The moon aids the earth by moderating the degree to which which it wobbles on its axis.  This stabilizes the climate and regulates the tides.  The moon is the only celestial body that humans have set foot on.  The temperature on Mars ranges from a low of -387 degrees Fahrenheit to a high of 253 degrees Fahrenheit.
